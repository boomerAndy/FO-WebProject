<h2 id="FrankInfoHeading">So what is Frank doing now?</h2>        
                <p>
                    After releasing Blonde, which many considered the album of the decade and making an extra 20 million by going independant, Frank got to rest for a bit. Sure he released a few singles here and there, but apart from a few tumblr updates and releasing the vinyl of Endless and Blonde on his website, he's been silent.<br>Until about October last year! He dropped the surprise single "DHL" for what is assumed to be a new album. Many people (myslef included) like this new sound, where Frank is seemingly going for more a club vibe to his tracks, all the while having deep lyricism and smart wordplay like we know and love. I would share some of the lyrics and the meaning behind them but I don't know if my college professors would be too happy about that 😅<br><br>He's also started playing at night clubs, teasing new tracks that only a select few get to hear live, while the rest of us have to listen through portrait recorded iphone footage, with people screaming in the background as you too wish you could get to hear new Frank material live :(. These live venues are also where this amazing photo of frank dressed like a trucker came from!

                    Frank has also been releasing some hot merch on his website blonded.co, from hoodies and tracksuits to keychains and underpants, and while owning a pair of Blonded branded socks or my very own blonded hoodie would be quite sick, some of the prices (140 euro for a Gildan threading hoodie + shipping and tax?? come on frank you're practically finnessing us now) aren't so hot. There's other stuff too, like a curated playlist called Blonded radio that recently got added to the video game Grand Theft Auto 5, so Frank really has made it. I urge you to check out Frank's website, it's quite cool to check out the journey since Blonde up to now with singles,merch and all that Jazz. <br><a href="Blonded.co">Blonded.co</a>

            And with that, our story comes to an end! For now at least, Frank seems to be having a good time, and already has left an incredible legacy. All we can do now is wait and see what the Ocean man has in store for us, because Frank will drop his latest work eventually. When it's ready.</p>
