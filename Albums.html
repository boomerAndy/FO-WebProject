<h2 id="FrankInfoHeading">Beginning Career, Odd Future and Nostalgia Ultra</h2>        
                <p>
                    After moving to Los Angeles in 2006 to pursue his music career, Frank worked multiple jobs at several fast-food and other service jobs to support himself. After only 3 years in the music scene he made a name for himself as a songwriter working with the likes of Justin Bieber, John Legend and Beyoncé(mtv). Frank later said "I was compromising myself for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family."(Wikipedia) He felt burned out from songwriting and took a short break, but that soon ended when he found new life as part of the Los Angeles-based hip hop collective, Odd Future.

                <h2 id="OFHeading">2009 - Odd Future</h2>
        <p>
            Frank joined the LA based hip hop collective Odd Future in Summer 2009, introducing him to the Hip Hop community. He contributed to multiple projects in the rap group like the beautiful rap ballad "Analog 2", and writing credits on "The OF Mixtape vol. 2". He has also appeared as a feature on multiple songs produced by other artists in the collective, most predominantly Tyler, the Creator on tracks like "Window" and "She". Frank has said his friendship with Tyler was key to reinvigorating his love for songwriting which can be seen in this music video for the final track on Odd Future's Mixtape vol. 2 where he pulls punches with other members of the OF collective like Tyler, Earl Sweatshirt, Domo Genesis and Jasper, having some banter along the way.</p>

        <p id="afterVid">These tracks caught the attention of record producer Trickey Stewart, who met with Frank and convinced him to sign a deal with Def Jam Recordings label, but this new record deal wouldn't be plain sailing.

            <h2 id="Nostalgia Ultra">2010/2011 - Nostalgia, Ultra</h2>
            <p>
                After being signed to Def Jam, Frank soon found out the label had no interest in him and didn't want to give him the neccesary funds to record music and later said he felt neglected by Def Jam, even Trickey Stewart said it wasn't the right call on his part, and the label couldn't get behind Frank the same way he was. So in 2011, Frank made the decision to begin a 7 year chess game to work his way out of his record deal that would see him Finess the record label of a reported 20 million dollars, but we'll get to that later. <br><br>Frank decided to take some inspiration from his friends at Odd Future and decided to put out his own mixtape to stir hype and create an audience all independantly. So on the 26th of Febuary 2011, Frank released his mixtape "Nostalgia, Ultra", which became a smash hit globally with 0 promotion, and now Def Jam are interested. They decide to release 2 singles off the mixtape, "Novacane" and "Swim Good", which hit #82 and #70 on the Billboard top 100. Listen to the tracks here to find out why they charted so fast!</p>

                <br>Nostalgia, Ultra was met with immediate acclaim, featuring samples from  Coldplay MGMT and radiohead, Frank's biggest influences and his favourite bands from a young age. The mixtape was praised for Frank's songwriting that focused on personal reflection, social commentary and Frank's past relationships("Understanding Frank Ocean", video essay by Volksgeist).<br>Unfortunately becuase almost every track on the album was full of samples, Def Jam weren't able to clear it for a commercial release because of too many expensive and unclearable samples like Hotel California by the Eagles on the song American Wedding. Fortunately, the community has been able to create physical copies of the album and I actually own a pressing of Nostagia, Ultra on vinyl and it's probably my favourite record that I own, the sound of Frank's voice is amazing, and I love the clear orange pressing of the record along with the artwork!

            <p>Now that Def Jam were eager to work with Frank after neglecting for nearly 2 years, Frank got knew he had them just where he wanted them, and was ready to begin the next stage of his chess game, his debut commercial album, Channel Orange.</p>

                <h2 id="FrankInfoHeading">Channel Orange, and the wait</h2>
                <p>
                    Now that Def Jam were desperate to make some money off the hype from Nostalgia, Ultra, Frank reportedly demanded 1 million dollars in funds for the project and total creative control. Def Jam agreed, and Frank got to writing the album, and wrote all of the songs in just 3 weeks. He released Channel Orange on July 10th 2012 to universal critical acclaim, being named best album of the year by critics at the HMV Polls and earned 6 grammy award nominations and winning the award for best urban contemporary album. Artists at the time credited the album for moving the R&amp;B genre in "different, challenging direction", featuring unconventional songs noted for their storytelling and social commentary, and a dense musical fusion that drew from hip hop, soul, and R&amp;B. Funk and electric music also influenced his album.

                </section>
                <p>In particular the songs about unrequited love received the most attention because Frank announced prior to the album's release that his first love was a man. The announcement made global headlines, and some critics compared its cultural impact to when David Bowie revealed that he was bisexual in 1972.(The Independent)<br><br>The image you can see in the background is the beautiful story Frank posted to his Tumblr all the way back in 2012, just prior to Channel Orange's release. <br>If the link hasn't been taken down, you can read the full post <a id="ThankYousLink" href="https://frankocean.tumblr.com/image/26473798723">here.</a><br><br>After the runaway success of Channel Orange, we would only see a handful of singles and features on other artists work from Frank. He kept to himself, not giving interviews after 2013 because of a disastrous GQ interview where the interviewer stepped over the line and pressed Frank about his sexuality, and Frank defended himself and his right to privacy. It would be another 4 years till He would drop the album to finess Def Jam out of his record deal experiment visual album "Endless", and the bombshell surprise hit of Summer 2016, Blond(e).

                <h2 id="FrankInfoHeading">Endless, Blonde and the Finesse</h2>
                <p>After many years of delays and teasers, In July of 2016 Frank posted to his website an image of a library titled "Boys Don't Cry" with multiple dates on it, implying due dates that were missed. The final date says July 2016. Finally on August  1st at aproximately 3am, a cryptic endless (no pun intended) livestream appears on the website boysdontcry.co, shot in negative in a Brooklyn warehouse sponsored by Apple Music, with sporadic instruments throughout, and showing Frank building a staircase, looping for a total of 140 hours. 2 weeks later on August 18th/19th, at midnight the music from the project was dropped on Apple music, titled "Endless".<br>It would be Frank's last album with Def Jam to fulfill his contract with the record label. Before Endless released on Apple Music, Frank was making efforts to part ways with Def Jam as previously discussed. He describes his negotiations with the label as a "seven-year chess game", while adding that he had replaced many of his representatives (including his lawyer and manager) during the process, as well as having to buy back all of his master recordings that previously belonged to Def Jam.("Frank Ocean Is Finally Free, Mystery Intact". The New York Times. November 16, 2016.)

                <p>But just as everyone had listened to the album, had a tear from it's beauty and Frank's singing, just one day later at midnight Pacific time on August 20th, a music video for a song titled "Nikes" dropped on Frank's Apple Music page and his website. Frank also announced pop up shops in LA, New York, Chicago and London for his magazine Boys Don't Cry, and released his real second studio album "Blond(e) to critical acclaim"</p>
