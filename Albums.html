<h2 id="FrankInfoHeading">Beginning Career, Odd Future and Nostalgia Ultra</h2>        
                <p>
                    After moving to Los Angeles in 2006 to pursue his music career, Frank worked multiple jobs at several fast-food and other service jobs to support himself. After only 3 years in the music scene he made a name for himself as a songwriter working with the likes of Justin Bieber, John Legend and Beyoncé(mtv). Frank later said "I was compromising myself for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family."(Wikipedia) He felt burned out from songwriting and took a short break, but that soon ended when he found new life as part of the Los Angeles-based hip hop collective, Odd Future.

                <h2 id="OFHeading">2009 - Odd Future</h2>
        <p>
            Frank joined the LA based hip hop collective Odd Future in Summer 2009, introducing him to the Hip Hop community. He contributed to multiple projects in the rap group like the beautiful rap ballad "Analog 2", and writing credits on "The OF Mixtape vol. 2". He has also appeared as a feature on multiple songs produced by other artists in the collective, most predominantly Tyler, the Creator on tracks like "Window" and "She". Frank has said his friendship with Tyler was key to reinvigorating his love for songwriting which can be seen in this music video for the final track on Odd Future's Mixtape vol. 2 where he pulls punches with other members of the OF collective like Tyler, Earl Sweatshirt, Domo Genesis and Jasper, having some banter along the way.</p>

            <h2 id="Nostalgia Ultra">2010/2011 - Nostalgia, Ultra</h2>
            <p>
                After being signed to Def Jam, Frank soon found out the label had no interest in him and didn't want to give him the neccesary funds to record music and later said he felt neglected by Def Jam, even Trickey Stewart said it wasn't the right call on his part, and the label couldn't get behind Frank the same way he was. So in 2011, Frank made the decision to begin a 7 year chess game to work his way out of his record deal that would see him Finess the record label of a reported 20 million dollars, but we'll get to that later. <br><br>Frank decided to take some inspiration from his friends at Odd Future and decided to put out his own mixtape to stir hype and create an audience all independantly. So on the 26th of Febuary 2011, Frank released his mixtape "Nostalgia, Ultra", which became a smash hit globally with 0 promotion, and now Def Jam are interested. They decide to release 2 singles off the mixtape, "Novacane" and "Swim Good", which hit #82 and #70 on the Billboard top 100. Listen to the tracks here to find out why they charted so fast!</p>

                <br>Nostalgia, Ultra was met with immediate acclaim, featuring samples from  Coldplay MGMT and radiohead, Frank's biggest influences and his favourite bands from a young age. The mixtape was praised for Frank's songwriting that focused on personal reflection, social commentary and Frank's past relationships("Understanding Frank Ocean", video essay by Volksgeist).<br>Unfortunately becuase almost every track on the album was full of samples, Def Jam weren't able to clear it for a commercial release because of too many expensive and unclearable samples like Hotel California by the Eagles on the song American Wedding. Fortunately, the community has been able to create physical copies of the album and I actually own a pressing of Nostagia, Ultra on vinyl and it's probably my favourite record that I own, the sound of Frank's voice is amazing, and I love the clear orange pressing of the record along with the artwork!

            <p>Now that Def Jam were eager to work with Frank after neglecting for nearly 2 years, Frank got knew he had them just where he wanted them, and was ready to begin the next stage of his chess game, his debut commercial album, Channel Orange.</p>
