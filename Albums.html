<h2>2006-2011</h2>
<h2 id="FrankInfoHeading">Beginning Career, Odd Future and Nostalgia Ultra</h2>        
                <p>
                    After moving to Los Angeles in 2006 to pursue his music career, Frank worked multiple jobs at several fast-food and other service jobs to support himself. After only 3 years in the music scene he made a name for himself as a songwriter working with the likes of Justin Bieber, John Legend and Beyoncé(mtv). Frank later said "I was compromising myself for other people, and it might have been comfy to continue to do that and enjoy that income stream and the anonymity. But that's not why I moved away from school and away from family."(Wikipedia) He felt burned out from songwriting and took a short break, but that soon ended when he found new life as part of the Los Angeles-based hip hop collective, Odd Future.

        <p>
            Frank joined the LA based hip hop collective Odd Future.<br>Unfortunately that very same year Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in August of 2005, destroying his home and personal recording studio. This forced him to transfer to Uni Louisiana, but it was short lived and he dropped out soon after.
